<H1>Create a Database to test Keystroke Dynamics Authentication algorithms</H1>

Keystroke Dynamics is a biometric technique used to authenticate users by their typing.

<H3>BioKeyCapture 2.5</H3>
It is an application to measure the Keystroke Dynamics of users who voluntarily collaborate with the author's research. This is a study on Keystroke Dynamic, so it is necessary to collect keystroke samples from various users to form an analysis dataset. The data will be used exclusively for research purposes and the author undertakes to protect the identity of the participants. The participants are free to choose when to leave the collaboration and are not subject to any legal agreement that binds them. The author thanks all those who have willingly agreed to collaborate with the investigation.

<H3>BioKeyAnalyze 1.0</H3>
It is an application to analyze and compare Keystroke Dynamics patterns collected by BioKeyCapture application.
It allows you to superimpose on a graph the patterns of the same user or those of several users.
It shows the di-graph, tri-graph, even penta-graph and also shows the Duration, which is the measure of the time the key remains pressed.
